PEER REVIEW: Brandon Le - I really liked the data validation in this project. I entered numbers multiple times for every user input and it still repeated endlessly. I know in a lot of other code I've seen including mine the error messges for data validation loops for a certain amount of times but not endlessly. The entire project worked as intended and I was not able to see any errors. The only thing I think would be nice is if when the user inputs just an empty space, it takes that empty space and uses it for the story. However at the end if you hit enter instead of yes or no, it still loops until you make a choice. It would be nice if you could do the same with the noun, verb, etc inputs as well.  But overall really good job and cool mad lib.
